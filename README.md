# Dataset-of-Multispectral-Plants-Images
This github repo has been created to store files related to the Agricultural Vision Segmentation Challenge. The dataset contains 101 aerial images .Each image contains color channels which are RGB and Near Infra-Red.https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kvL87iV5kXDoskaH_kMDPjcf4PA8y33a

Pattern recognition from aerial agricultural images presents several challenges. This includes the variations of patterns you are looking to classify, the amount of annotated patters and the properties of the annotation(like shape, texture or depth). This distinguishes aerial pattern recognition from object recognition and the former is a more challenged task. These challenges are not present in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more challenging than many other aerial image datasets.
